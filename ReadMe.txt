# Jupyter Notebook to create the file: efficiencies.npzCreate a NumPy binary file having the polarization and flipping efficiencies vs. neutron wavelength.  This file is needed by Module2 in the time-of-flight binning routine.The routine requires four neutron cross-section measurements of the beam (4 files) and files corresponding to the background (another 4 files).Formulas used to calculate the efficiencies are shown in the PowerPoint file.The notebook calls a Python routine written by T. Charlton.M.R. Fitzsimmons 03.12.22
